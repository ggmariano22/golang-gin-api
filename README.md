## Go API with Gin

Project created for study purposes.

You can run the project with `go run main.go` command.

TODO items:
* Create an development environment with docker
* Implement live reload with [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air)

For now we have 2 simple endpoints:
* `GET /products` retrive all products stored in database
* `POST /products` store a batch with one or more products
